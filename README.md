The beginning of a tag game through  git.

This is a practice update.

#Git Commits

#Git Branching

#Git Merging

#Git Rebasing
* The second way of combining work between branches is rebasing. Rebasing essentially takes a set of commits, "copies" them, and plops them down somewhere else.

While this sounds confusing, the advantage of rebasing is that it can be used to make a nice linear sequence of commits. The commit log / history of the repository will be a lot cleaner if only rebasing is allowed.


To complete this level, do the following

Checkout a new branch named bugFix
Commit once
Go back to main and commit again
Check out bugFix again and rebase onto main
Good luck!
