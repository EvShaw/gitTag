## This Repo
* this repo is a readME file intended to learn, grow, and help not only myself but others become more familiar with managing gitHub from the CLI. 

#Git Commits

#Git Branching

#Git Merging

#Git Rebasing
* The second way of combining work between branches is rebasing. Rebasing essentially takes a set of commits, "copies" them, and plops them down somewhere else.

While this sounds confusing, the advantage of rebasing is that it can be used to make a nice linear sequence of commits. The commit log / history of the repository will be a lot cleaner if only rebasing is allowed.
